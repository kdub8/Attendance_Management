# Attendance_Management
My C++ program is a versatile attendance management system designed to cater to the needs of both students and administrators. 
For students, it offers a streamlined way to mark their attendance with just a few clicks, ensuring accuracy and efficiency. 
They can also easily check their own attendance records at any time, providing them with valuable insights into their attendance patterns.

Administrators, on the other hand, have access to a range of powerful features. They can delete students who are no longer part of the institution, register new students with all the necessary details, and maintain an up-to-date list of all students enrolled. 
Additionally, administrators can retrieve comprehensive attendance reports for all students, helping them monitor attendance trends and take necessary actions when needed. This C++ program simplifies attendance management, promoting accountability and ensuring that both students and administrators can easily access the attendance information they require.
